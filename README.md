pullrequest
===========

A simple command line tool to open your browser to a GitHub diff page.

Reads your GitHub account name from package.json repository.url and your current branch from git.

Install: `sudo npm install -g pullrequest`

Then run `pullrequest` to open your browser with the diff from your current branch to your GitHub default branch (master).

To change the target branch run `pullrequest to release3` to open your browser with a diff from your current branch to release3.
